# INDOLOGY-forum-archives
Searchable archives of the INDOLOGY discussion forum.

The INDOLOGY listserv forum was launched in November 1990 by Dominik Wujastyk.  This was the first message:

```
Date: Fri, 23 Nov 90 09:47:58 +0000
From: Dominik Wujastyk <ucgadkwatUK.AC.UCL>
Subject: Welcome to the new INDOLOGY list.

This is -- I believe -- the first message of human origin to be posted
to the new INDOLOGY discussion list.  (You will have received a
standard, introductory message, explaining some of the technical
workings of this system; it is very straightforward in normal use.)

So may I welcome you warmly to this new forum, and encourage you to
contribute your thoughts, queries, answers, observations, and
announcements relating to Indology.

A very useful theme might be for members to issue notices of texts that
they have in machine readable form.  In order to make it easy to find
such notices amongst the other INDOLOGY messages, as they begin to
accumulate, may I suggest that we use a standard phrase such as
"Machine readable text: ..." in the "Subject:" field of such messages?

Best wishes,

Dominik

Since then, membership has grown to about 850 members (Spring 2023).  The forum has a website 
at http://indology.info (also redirected from http://indology.net) that supports the online forum with 
information and assistance with joining.  The forum is managed by a volunteer management committee.

# Searchable indexes
There have been ongoing difficulties with the Mailman function for searching the forum's archive of messages.

The main purpose of this repository is to develop an independently-hosted search function for the archive.
